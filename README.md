# My-First-Dashboard
The first time I ever had to make a dashboard - Nostalgic
The task was to look for products we should/shouldn't invest in and upload a video presentation explaining the suggestions made using your dashboard as a visual aid.

My suggestion was to decrease investment in the half finger gloves and further invest into both Men's Bib-Shorts and Women's Tights.

Good times :)
